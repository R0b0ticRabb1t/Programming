## hii

So this repository is just a place where i'm learning how to program again, this time in rust.
Its mostly going to be based on the [experimental rust tutorial](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/experiment-intro.html), and hopefully sooner or later have small projects of algorithms i learned in the [IITM DS Degree](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/).
